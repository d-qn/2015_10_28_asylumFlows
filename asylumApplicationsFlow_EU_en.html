<div id="footer"> <strong>How to read this graphic:</strong><br>Move your mouse over the graphic to read more about the data. If you mouse over the countries (at the top or at the bottom), it will show the total number of asylum applications by country and the percentages as a fraction of all applications. If you move over a ribbon, you will see the same for a given country of origin and destination. Countries can be reordered by clicking, holding and dragging. Or they can be sorted alphabetically ("alpha") or by size ("size").  </div>
